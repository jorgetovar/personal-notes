# Clean Agile

Great thing are made of small teams making smalls things
Agile provides data
The customer doesnt know what he wants
Agile is not a mini-waterfall : Rather the activities of architecture, design, implementation are continous throught the iteration
Agile is not about going fast is about destroying hope though continous feedback
Adding man power to a late project can have a negative impact: Learning curve, communication complexity
the only way to go fast is to go well
