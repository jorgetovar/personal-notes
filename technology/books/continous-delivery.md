- Invest in automation and continous delivery to use your time to add business value not waste time in bug fixes
- Improve release pipelines and tests (focus in business and automation)
- Cycle times are one of the most important metrics to track
- Pipeline that dont give you the confidence of deploy an artifact is not a good pipeline  (Security, ATDD, TDD, Performance)
