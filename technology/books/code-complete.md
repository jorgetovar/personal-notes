Be sure you know that you're aiming before you shoot
Managing complexity is the most important techinical topic in software development
Architecture changes are expensive to make during construction or later
Risk reduction

Software complexity is one of the major topics of our area
- Essential complexity
- Incidental complexity

we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. 

 Clever designs are usually hard to understand. Instead make "simple" and "easy-to-understand" designs

 - Ease of maintance
 - Loose coupling
 - Extensability
 - Reusability
 - Portability
 - Stratification

 Abstraction is the ability to engage with a concept while safely ignoring some of its details

 From a complexity point of view, the principal benefit of abstraction is that it allows you to ignore irrelevant details
