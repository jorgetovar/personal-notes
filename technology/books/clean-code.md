Abstraction is the key to simple code

Saying no its as important as saying yes and taking responsability

Donâ€™t write code when you are tired. Dedication and professionalism are more about discipline than hours. Make sure that your sleep, health, and lifestyle are tuned so that you can put in eight good hours per day.

If you compromise the structure you compromise the future

Follow your disciplines under pressure... Add more test more refactors and more pairing
Estimation are distributions and always meet the commitment
Programmers must understand businesses goals
Products are better than projects
Test behaviors not classes

- Domain driven design code starts with names but is more
- 10x developer if you make 10 people better
- Technical debt : Invest time in writing test and automation tools not debugging
- Create software as a sustainable code not speed and rot
