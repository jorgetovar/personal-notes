# Clean code

You can rewrite your project keeping only the test
Tell a story 
Write a single behavior per spec
Write code that makes code easier to write
Old code is a trainer for new people
Write code than other people can mantain
Minimize the maintanibility risk
Good-Fast-Cheap-Done
The largest threat to reaching scale from a technical perspective was to be complexity, for the both system and the team

### Interview 

How to write hard to test code:
- Global variables
- Law of demeter violation
- Global reference to time
- New operators
- Lack of dependency injection


- readibility
- test
- Well written prose
- fewer elementd
- easy to change 
- easy to understood
- Remove duplication
- sensors, decide , act

- CAP: 
    * Consistency: all nodes see the same data
    * Availability: every request receive a response [success/failure]
    * Partition Tolerance;  system continoues to operate despite arbitrary messages

- Databases NoSQL, documental store, K.V, Graph, Columnar
- Lenguage decision is based on Ecosystem, experience, performance and expresiveness, feedback loop
- Working code is not enough you must reduce complexity
- Clean boundaries and adapter pattern

# Enterpreurs
 - Magic number
 - Customer lifetime value
 - Metrics: activation, retention, reffereal, revenue, magic number
 - Design is important

# Startup 

- Essential complexity and accidental complexity that you must handle, with invest in productivity, reliability and simplicity  
- Teams must be autonomous and leverage automation to avoid human error
- The stronger the culture, the less company process are needed
- In a startup the most important thing is the why
- Lock free: avoid release manager and people intervention, work toward a goal should never be blocked
- Manager. 1 place to work with others, 2 a place where you do focused work, 3 a place where you can go away from work 4 a way to customize the office for personal needs
- Manager Individual contributor radio
- Mission is the startup why
- Rollback, canary release and feature flags are necessary to embrace continous integration
- Metrics... Business metrics. User, application and availability
- Acceptance test and loose coupling are important
=======
### Bugs
- Most expensive in production
- Expensive in QA
- Cheaper to fix in Dev
- Least expensive to avoid in design

### Qualities

- Problem solver
- Skilled
- Mentor
- Excellent learner

Abstraction is the key to simple code

Saying no its as important as saying yes and taking responsability

Donâ€™t write code when you are tired. Dedication and professionalism are more about discipline than hours. Make sure that your sleep, health, and lifestyle are tuned so that you can put in eight good hours per day.

If you compromise the structure you compromise the future
Remove ambiguity between stakeholders & developers with automation and acceptance TDD
Automate happy paths with business and unhappy paths
IT evolve from support to Source of competitive differentiation (develop in house talent)
Promote craftmanship and outcume instead of speed features
Unburden top people.. Give time to code and Problem solvong instead of bureocratic navigation hurdles and progress review and updates
Follow your disciplines under pressure... Add more test more refactors and more pairing
Estimation are distributions and always meet the commitment
Programmers must understand businesses goals
Products are better than projects
Test behaviors not classes

# Lean Software

- Remove code .. negative value: culture and mindset
- No code is the best code
- Domain driven design code starts with names but is more
- 10x developer if you make 10 people better
- Technical debt : Invest time in writing test and automation tools not debugging
- Create software as a sustainable code not speed and rot

# Programers oath

- Dont ship harmful code
- Do your best possible work
- Make a repetible and quick form of proof of your software delivery correctness
- Improve teams productivity
- Cover each other 
- Provide real stimations
- Make frequent small releases
- I will fearless improve my creations at every opportunity
- I will never stop learning and improve my craft

# Peopleware

- Productivity = Benefit /cost
- Creative work needs time to generate the best outcome
- Make quality set by the buyer rather than the builder
- People under pressure don't work better they work faster

# Startups

- Big will not beat small anymore. The fastest will be beating the slow
- A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that work
- Startups provide great autonomy and make you to take significant decisions
- Purpose, Mastery, Autonomy
