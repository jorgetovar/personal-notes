# Crafmanship

- Extreme programming
  * TDD
  * Pair programming
- Career roadmap //TODO0
- Dream job //TODO0
- Autonomy, mastery and purpose
- Refactoring
- Clean code
- Continous delivery
- **Look for a company that match our principles, values, culture, tech stack**
- Github account, blog, open source contributions and technical communities
- **Autonomy**: Control, **Mastery**: Learning, improve, **Purpose**: Goal
- What's the **business value** of all this technical stuff : Quality, Predicatability, Maintainability, Flexibility
- Mentorship
- Architecture, code should reflect intent

## Interviews

- Code submits
- Passionate about techniligy
- Learning roadmap
- Important topics
- Multi phase and analize different aspects
- Talk abour real scenarios exploring differents approachs and solutions

## Best practices

- Modularity
- Takes apart time/order/flow : queues, idempotency, communication, transactions
- Good design is separate into things that can be composed
- Each component should be about one or a few things
- Agile is about generating value with quality
- Building the rigth thing and the thing right
- Autonomous teams, remove dependencies
- How it's done is as important as getting done
- Make it run, then make it right, then make it fast
- Programmer time is expensive
- Data driven applications
- Robustness it's the product of simplicity + testeability
- Unix: Clarity, composition
- Conwoy's law : systems are constrained to communication structures of these organizations
- **its harder to read code than write it**
- The only form to go fast it's to go well√ß

## Job 

- Innovation
- Sharing 
- Architecture
- Book 
- Technical groups

## Technical debt

- Hard to change
- Could be architecture, Code, Documentation

## Agile

- Focus on outcome not outputs
